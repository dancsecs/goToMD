# Package goToMd

<!--- goToMD::Bgn::doc::./package -->
```go
package main
```

The goToMD utility provides for the maintenance of github README.MD style
pages by permitting go files, go documentation and go test output to be
included by reference into the github README.md file directly from the Go
code permitting program documentation to be maintained in one place (the Go
code.)

It can use a template file (```*.md.gtm```) or can maintain a ```*.md``` file
in place.

Usage of goToMD [-c | -r] [-fvl] [-p perm] [-o outDir] path [path...]

The flags are:

    -c
        Reverse operation and remove generated markdown (Cannot be used
        with the -r option). Files with a .md extension are expected with
        a an .md.gtm file being produced.
    -f
        Do not confirm overwrite of destination.
    -l
        Display license before program exits.
    -o string
        Direct all output to the specified directory. (default ".")
    -p int
        Permissions to use when creating new file (can only set RW
        bits). (default 420)
    -r
        Replace the *.MD in place (Cannot be used with the -c flag).
    -v
        Provide more information woth respect to processing.

Directives are placed into the ```*.md.gtm``` file (or directly into the
```*.md``` document if the replace in place option is given.  These directves
are emebbed into HTML style comments.
